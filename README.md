Group habit tracker

## Motivation

- Expansion of programming knowledge and confidence in writing React
- A useful app for using with friends - habit club - accountability between friends to help with life

## Problem

There isn't a decent, clutter free and money free app that allows you to track habits, share progress with friends, but also notify them when you need help staying on track with a specific habit.

## Problem Statement

Free, habit tracking platform that focuses on:

- Peer motivation
- Peer accountability
- Evidence-based reflection & self-improvement

## Features

### Core

To gain parity with existing processes/workflow/tools:

- Add a task/habit, and then record in a day whether or not the goal has been met.
- Can record additional metadata associated with the habit (e.g. number of times water has been drunk)
- Be able to view overview of habits currently assigned to yourself over the course of a configurable time period (week, fortnight, month, etc.)
- View history of one specific habit
- Mark a habit as non-negotiable/compulsory
  Group level habit tracking - exercise but split into multiple e.g. gym, tennis, badminton, but the habit progress can be viewed by the category

### Peer Motivation

- Shabash mechanism
- Feedback & encouragement on completion of peer habits
- Gamification
  - Streaks
- Shared habits in a group - all commit to the same habit

### Peer Accountability

- View friends' habits
- Can choose which habits you share with a friend
- Mechanism to notify friends if you haven't completed a compulsory habit by the allocated time/date

### Reflection

- View insights into habits - configurable by time period
  - Completion rate
  - Related habits
- Over time, reduce the conscious thinking and effort required to complete the action.

## Concepts

- Habit: An action that leads to fulfilment in your life. Defined by action, frequency, intensity, impact (life-wise and feelings-wise).
- Entry: A recording of a habit against the defined frequency. Captures the completion, effort, metadata.
- History: A collection of entries to show the recorded entries for a given habit.

## Brand meaning

- Dot shift
  - Pause and consciously reflect
  - Then shift your perspective, your thoughts and your actions; then your life will shift
